# Final Project
We created a website where people with an interest in culture and/or nature, can discover new places in Stockholm which are a bit unknown. 
We have listed a selection of different landmarks, and all registered users can connect with others who wants to visit the same location. That way - you can both explore new areas in Stockholm, and meet new friends who share the same interests as you.

This is the final project of our education,
